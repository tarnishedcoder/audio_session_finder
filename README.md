# Audio Session Matcher üéµ

A user-friendly desktop application built with Python and Tkinter for managing and matching audio files to their corresponding Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) session files. Ideal for audio engineers, producers, and hobbyists looking to streamline file organization and enhance workflow.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Drag & Drop Support**: Easily add audio files to the application for processing
- **File Metadata Display**: View selected audio files and their last modified dates in an organized table
- **DAW Session Matching**: Automatically find DAW session files (e.g., .ptx, .als, .flp) that are timestamped within 24 hours of the selected audio files
- **Custom Search**: Choose a directory to scan for matching DAW session files
- **Clear Results**: Reset selected files and results with a single click
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Tkinter for a clean and intuitive graphical interface

## üìÅ Supported File Types

### Audio Files
- `.mp3`

- `.m4a`

### DAW Session Files
- **Pro Tools**: `.ptx`, `.ptf`
- **Logic Pro**: `.logic`
- **Ableton Live**: `.als`

## üîç How It Works

2. Use the "Find Matching Sessions" button to search for DAW session files in a specified directory
3. View matched results, including the session file name, corresponding DAW, and modification date, in the results table
4. Clear selections and results to start a new search as needed
